# Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project
Domain: Data Engineering | Cloud Computing | Data Lake Architecture | AWS | BI Analytics
Overview:
This project focuses on building an end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline to ingest, transform, store, and analyze structured and semi-structured YouTube video data. The core objective is to efficiently manage video metadata and trending metrics, categorized by video topics, in a scalable and secure cloud environment. The end output is an interactive BI dashboard answering key analytical questions.
Project Goals:
Data Ingestion: Collect data from multiple structured and semi-structured sources, including JSON/CSV files representing YouTube video details and statistics.
ETL System: Build a robust Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process to clean, validate, and enrich the raw data into analytics-ready datasets.
Data Lake Formation: Store all raw and transformed data in a centralized Amazon S3 data lake using well-defined folder partitions (raw, processed, curated zones).
Scalability: Design the system with scalability in mind to efficiently process increasing volumes of data with minimal changes.
Cloud Deployment: Offload heavy data processing tasks to the cloud using AWS to ensure performance, cost-effectiveness, and manageability.
Reporting: Build a dashboard using Amazon QuickSight to visualize key KPIs such as views, likes, trending categories, most engaging content, etc.
